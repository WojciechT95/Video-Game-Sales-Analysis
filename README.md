## Insights and Conclusions

- Sports games are the most popular, which is understandable given how many different editions of FIFA have been created, and that tournaments from these games have a cult following.

- The most profitable console remains invariably the PS2, which for a long time was unrivaled. Data shows that next-generation consoles have not beaten their sales results, however, a large amount of data of games produced after 2018 does not include sales results, as can be seen in the charts.

- The biggest consumers of games are customers from Europe and North America

- The most profitable remain the Call of Duty series and Grand Theft Auto V, games that were released between 2008 and 2013.
